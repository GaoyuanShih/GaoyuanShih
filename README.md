- 👋 Hi, I’m @GaoyuanShih
- 👀 I’m interested in severl aspects such as musical theather, the game Path to Nowhere, Harry Potter movies and maybe postcard together with Les Mis and so on, i just got too much hobbies!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I can write simple codes in python but i'm pretty sure that there's still a long way away.
- 📕 I'm an alevel student and i choose to study math, further math, computer science and physics.
- Before i expect to learn programing in the computerscience class but then i find the computer science subject is all about theory:(
- 💞️ I’m looking to study more about something related to like OCR or computer vison. These sound tough and i know i shall study machine learning and something related to math and something network...A way away to go!
